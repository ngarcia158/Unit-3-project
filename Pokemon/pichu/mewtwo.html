        <p>Mewtwo  is a result of years of gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments
             from the pokemon mew. It is suspected that ditto are the failed results of 
             the experiments because they are the only other pokemon besides mew that can
              use transform. Due to the way that it was engineered the creators failed to
               give mewtwo a compassionate heart. With them forgetting that mewtwo only desires 
               battle to prove its strength.</p>
