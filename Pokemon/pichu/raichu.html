            <p>Raichu is a rodent like pokemon and the evolution of pikachu and pichu.
                 It evolves from a pikachu after you give it a thunderstone. 
                 Raichu gathers electricity from the atmosphere and stores it in its body. 
                 Raichu can store up to 100,000 volts of electricity in its body which 
                is enough to render a dragonite unconscious. The more electricity it has stored the more aggressive it is. 
                To prevent this raichu sends electricity into the ground with their tail.</p>
