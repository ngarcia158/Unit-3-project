        Darkrai is a shadow like pokemon that is able to cause horrific nightmares. It only causes 
        nightmares in self defence or to give warnings about future events. 
        Due to its abilities people tend to think of Darkrai as an evil pokemon but that 
        couldnâ€™t be further from the truth because it likes to help and protect 
        other pokemon. In the movie pokemon darkrai returns 
        it tries to stop palkia and dialga from fighting to save a city from 
        certain destruction. It dies in the process but still saved everyone.
