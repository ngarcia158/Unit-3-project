        <p>Charmander is a fire-type Pokemon his body is orange colored and a pale belly. His health 
            can be determined by the flame on his tail which will burn brighter the more healthy it is, 
            it also displays Charmanders emotions it burns brighter the more angry and if he growls it means 
            he is going to attack. The more his tail burns the more damage they do. Charmander is the nicest
             and most well behaved out of his evolution line. Doesn’t like being rushed so they can’t deal with 
             impatient people but extremely loyal. Can be found in the wild but very rare because it is a starting 
             Pokemon  but can be found near hot areas such as active volcanoes or in craggy mountains and in caves .
